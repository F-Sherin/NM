Project Description
The Product Catalog with Filters is a dynamic web application designed to enhance product browsing and discovery through an interactive and user-friendly interface. It allows users to view a collection of products and refine their search using multiple filter options such as category, price range, brand, and customer rating. The system is built with modular components that support real-time filtering, responsive design, and scalable data handling.
The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or React, providing a clean layout and seamless user experience. Product data is sourced from a structured JSON file or a MongoDB database, ensuring consistency and ease of access. The filtering logic is implemented to handle compound conditions efficiently, allowing users to apply multiple filters simultaneously without performance lag.
This project demonstrates practical web development skills by combining UI design, data manipulation, and client-side interactivity. It serves as a foundational model for e-commerce platforms, inventory systems, and any application requiring categorized item browsing. The system is designed to be easily extendable, with potential future enhancements including sorting, cart integration, and user authentication.
